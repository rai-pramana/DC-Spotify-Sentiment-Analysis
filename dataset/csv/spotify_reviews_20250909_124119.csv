You have to watch 3-4 ads to listen 4-5 songs. Bring back old Spotify where you get unlimited skips play songs in order and you just have to watch 1 ad for 5 songs or just make this app paid on play store literally you are making this app trash (this review is about free Spotify),1,0,9.0.74.1121,2025-09-06 23:08:39,,,9.0.74.1121

Extra step vs other popular music apps just to start a radio based on an artist. Other navigation areas need improvement.. Be able to have your 3 recent stations when you hold the app icon like Pandora would be cool. Be good if you could fine tune a station like in Pandora and YTMusic. thanks,2,0,,2025-07-28 11:53:51,"Hi! We appreciate your feedback.

Have been using it since 2014. But now it has become too crowded with sidefunctions, too visually unappealing and polluted, with many unnecessary features at the front page at the same time. Sometimes, the less the better, and in this case, it would be great to undo the cramming of unsolicited music and podcast and video suggestions on the app main page. Or offer an alt main page version clean and minimalist. Thanks.",4,0,9.0.74.1121,2025-08-30 05:39:14,,,9.0.74.1121

I cannot remember the proof of this, but it exists, I assure you. OLD 11/19/23: Spotify doesn't listen to it's listeners. The only reason I'm giving this a less than average review is because of it's broken mechanics. Please LMK if you have a better recommendation for music. I LOVE the audiobooks and that you can add songs to multiple lists at a time.
